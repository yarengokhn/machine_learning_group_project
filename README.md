## Colab Experiment (Individual Contribution)

This experiment was executed in Google Colab to validate the full training pipeline.

### Environment
- Platform: Google Colab
- Hardware: GPU (T4)
- Frameworks: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers

### Dataset
- CodeSearchNet (Python)
- ~455,000 samples
- Full tokenization and preprocessing completed

### Training
- Training successfully started on GPU
- One full epoch completed
- Training loss after epoch 1: ~4.67
- Training stopped due to Colab GPU time limits (expected behavior)

This confirms that the training pipeline works end-to-end.
